            The paper describes the mixed counting system in Mangarevan, which is unique in that it had three binary steps superposed onto a decimal structure. In showing how these steps affect calculation, our analysis yields important insights for theorizing on numerical cognition: counting systems serve as complex cultural tools for numerical cognition, apparently unwieldy systems may in fact be cognitively advantageous, and such advantageous systems can be—and have been—developed by nonindustrialized societies and in the absence of notational systems. These insights also help to dismiss simple notions of cultural complexity as a homogenous state and emphasize that investigating cultural diversity is not merely an optional extra, but a must.
          , 
            When Leibniz demonstrated the advantages of the binary system for computations as early as 1703, he laid the foundation for computing machines. However, is a binary system also suitable for human cognition? One of two number systems traditionally used on Mangareva, a small island in French Polynesia, had three binary steps superposed onto a decimal structure. Here, we show how this system functions, how it facilitated arithmetic, and why it is unique. The Mangarevan invention of binary steps, centuries before their formal description by Leibniz, attests to the advancements possible in numeracy even in the absence of notation and thereby highlights the role of culture for the evolution of and diversity in numerical cognition.},

	abstract = {Chu spaces are a recently developed model of concurrent computation extending automata theory to express branching time and true concurrency. They exhibit in a primitive form the quantum mechanical phenomena of complementarity and uncertainty. The complementarity arises as the duality of information and time, automata and schedules, and states and events. Uncertainty arises when we define a measurement to be a morphism and notice that increasing structure in the observed object reduces clarity of observation. For a Chu space this uncertainty can be calculated numerically an an attractively sample way directly from its form factor to yield the usual Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Chu spaces correspond to wavefunctions as vectors of Hilbert space, whose inner product operation is realized f o r Chu spaces as right residuation and whose quantum logic becomes Girard’s linear logic.},

Early investigations go back to at least the 1930s, but the twenty-first century has seen a remarkable blossoming of the mathematics of folding. Besides its use in describing origami and designing new models, it is also finding real-world applications from building nano-scale robots to deploying large solar arrays in space. Written by a world expert on the subject, Origametry is the first complete reference on the mathematics of origami. It brings together historical results, modern developments, and future directions into a cohesive whole. Over 180 figures illustrate the constructions described while numerous 'diversions' provide jumping-off points for readers to deepen their understanding. This book is an essential reference for researchers of origami mathematics and its applications in physics, engineering, and design. Educators, students, and enthusiasts will also find much to enjoy in this fascinating account of the mathematics of folding.},

	abstract = {A (closed) dynamical system is a notion of how things can be, together with a notion of how they may change given how they are. The idea and mathematics of closed dynamical systems has proven incredibly useful in those sciences that can isolate their object of study from its environment. But many changing situations in the world cannot be meaningfully isolated from their environment - a cell will die if it is removed from everything beyond its walls. To study systems that interact with their environment, and to design such systems in a modular way, we need a robust theory of open dynamical systems. In this extended abstract, we put forward a general definition of open dynamical system. We define two general sorts of morphisms between these systems: covariant morphisms which include trajectories, steady states, and periodic orbits; and contravariant morphisms which allow for plugging variables of some systems into parameters of other systems. We define an indexed double category of open dynamical systems indexed by their interface and use a double Grothendieck construction to construct a double category of open dynamical systems. In our main theorem, we construct covariantly representable indexed double functors from the indexed double category of dynamical systems to an indexed double category of spans. This shows that all covariantly representable structures of dynamical systems - including trajectories, steady states, and periodic orbits - compose according to the laws of matrix arithmetic.},

Reflecting more than forty years of Le Guin's personal study and contemplation, her rendering of the text is a brilliant testament to her deep-seated understanding of Taoist principles and their value for our troubled world today. Avoiding traditional patriarchal interpretations, scholarly fixations, and esotericism, she embues the Tao Te Ching with transformative, awe-inspiring power like no other.

Close kinship may be more a consequence of eusociality than a factor promoting its origin. A point of no return to the solitary state exists, as a rule when workers become anatomically differentiated. Eusociality has been rare in evolution, evidently due to the scarcity of environmental pressures adequate to tip the balance among countervailing forces in favor of group selection. Eusociality in ants and termites in the irreversible stage is the key to their ecological dominance and has (at least in ants) shaped some features of internal phylogeny. Their colonies are consistently superior to solitary and preeusocial competitors, due to the altruistic behavior among nestmates and their ability to organize coordinated action by pheromonal communication.},

	abstract = {Multitask prompted finetuning ({MTF}) has been shown to help large language models generalize to new tasks in a zero-shot setting, but so far explorations of {MTF} have focused on English data and models. We apply {MTF} to the pretrained multilingual {BLOOM} and {mT}5 model families to produce finetuned variants called {BLOOMZ} and {mT}0. We find finetuning large multilingual language models on English tasks with English prompts allows for task generalization to non-English languages that appear only in the pretraining corpus. Finetuning on multilingual tasks with English prompts further improves performance on English and non-English tasks leading to various state-of-the-art zero-shot results. We also investigate finetuning on multilingual tasks with prompts that have been machine-translated from English to match the language of each dataset. We find training on these machine-translated prompts leads to better performance on human-written prompts in the respective languages. Surprisingly, we find models are capable of zero-shot generalization to tasks in languages they have never intentionally seen. We conjecture that the models are learning higher-level capabilities that are both task- and language-agnostic. In addition, we introduce {xP}3, a composite of supervised datasets in 46 languages with English and machine-translated prompts.

              A special developmental program in the human brain drives the disproportionate thickening of cortical layer 2/3. This suggests that the expansion of layer 2/3, along with its numerous neurons and their large dendrites, may contribute to what makes us human. Gidon

              thus investigated the dendritic physiology of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in slices taken from surgically resected brain tissue in epilepsy patients. Dual somatodendritic recordings revealed previously unknown classes of action potentials in the dendrites of these neurons, which make their activity far more complex than has been previously thought. These action potentials allow single neurons to solve two long-standing computational problems in neuroscience that were considered to require multilayer neural networks.

            Dendritic action potentials extend the repertoire of computations available to human neurons.
          , 
            The active electrical properties of dendrites shape neuronal input and output and are fundamental to brain function. However, our knowledge of active dendrites has been almost entirely acquired from studies of rodents. In this work, we investigated the dendrites of layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the human cerebral cortex ex vivo. In these neurons, we discovered a class of calcium-mediated dendritic action potentials ({dCaAPs}) whose waveform and effects on neuronal output have not been previously described. In contrast to typical all-or-none action potentials, {dCaAPs} were graded; their amplitudes were maximal for threshold-level stimuli but dampened for stronger stimuli. These {dCaAPs} enabled the dendrites of individual human neocortical pyramidal neurons to classify linearly nonseparable inputs—a computation conventionally thought to require multilayered networks.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

We believe that the possibility of mesa-optimization raises two important questions for the safety and transparency of advanced machine learning systems. First, under what circumstances will learned models be optimizers, including when they should not be? Second, when a learned model is an optimizer, what will its objective be - how will it differ from the loss function it was trained under - and how can it be aligned? In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of these two primary questions and provide an overview of topics for future research.},

	abstract = {State of the art language models return a natural language text continuation from any piece of input text. This ability to generate coherent text extensions implies significant sophistication, including a knowledge of grammar and semantics. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework for passing from probability distributions on extensions of given texts, such as the ones learned by today's large language models, to an enriched category containing semantic information. Roughly speaking, we model probability distributions on texts as a category enriched over the unit interval. Objects of this category are expressions in language, and hom objects are conditional probabilities that one expression is an extension of another. This category is syntactical -- it describes what goes with what. Then, via the Yoneda embedding, we pass to the enriched category of unit interval-valued copresheaves on this syntactical category. This category of enriched copresheaves is semantic -- it is where we find meaning, logical operations such as entailment, and the building blocks for more elaborate semantic concepts.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many {NLP} tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current {NLP} systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train {GPT}-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, {GPT}-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. {GPT}-3 achieves strong performance on many {NLP} datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where {GPT}-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where {GPT}-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that {GPT}-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of {GPT}-3 in general.},

	abstract = {We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over {\textbackslash}nummodels language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, {\textbackslash}chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as {\textbackslash}gopher but with 70B parameters and 4\${\textbackslash}times\$ more more data. {\textbackslash}chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms {\textbackslash}Gopher (280B), {GPT}-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing {NLG} (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that {\textbackslash}chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, {\textbackslash}chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5{\textbackslash}\% on the {MMLU} benchmark, greater than a 7{\textbackslash}\% improvement over {\textbackslash}gopher.},

However, there is a common conception that {ADHD} is overdiagnosed. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the evidence for and against overdiagnosis. Method: Recent prevalence studies and research on factors affecting diagnostic accuracy were reviewed. For {ADHD} to be overdiagnosed, the rate of false positives (i.e., children inappropriately diagnosed with {ADHD}) must substantially exceed the number of false negatives (children with {ADHD} who are not identified or diagnosed). Results and Conclusion: Based on the review of prevalence studies and research on the diagnostic process, there does not appear to be sufficient justification for the conclusion that {ADHD} is systematically overdiagnosed. Yet, this conclusion is generally not reflected in public perceptions or media coverage of {ADHD}. Potential explanations for the persistence of the belief in the overdiagnosis of {ADHD} are offered.

However, from that point on it tries to guide the reader through the thought processes and ideas that are needed to combine those patterns into more interesting composite ones. While the book largely follows the history of the Game of Life, that is {\textless}em{\textgreater}not{\textless}/em{\textgreater} its primary purpose. Rather, it is a by-product of the fact that most recently discovered patterns build upon patterns and techniques that were developed earlier.

At stage 1, place a single toothpick of length 1 on a square grid, aligned with the y-axis. At each subsequent stage, for every exposed toothpick end, place an orthogonal toothpick centered at that end. The resulting structure has a fractal-like appearance. We will analyze the toothpick sequence, which gives the total number of toothpicks after n steps. We also study several related sequences that arise from enumerating active cells in cellular automata. Some unusual recurrences appear: a typical example is that instead of the Fibonacci recurrence, which we may write as a(2+i) = a(i) + a(i+1), we set n = 2{\textasciicircum}k+i (0 {\textless}= i {\textless} 2{\textasciicircum}k), and then a(n)=a(2{\textasciicircum}k+i)=2a(i)+a(i+1). The corresponding generating functions look like Prod\{k {\textgreater}= 0\} (1+x{\textasciicircum}\{2{\textasciicircum}k-1\}+2x{\textasciicircum}\{2{\textasciicircum}k\}) and variations thereof.},

In consequence, those areas of social life which became markedly more simple during the formation of ‘complex’ societies – such as daily consumption –have received little attention. This paper seeks to problematize the evolution of social simplicity by introducing a concept of aesthetic labour into the analysis of social change. Aesthetic labour describes the whole complex of techniques, forms of knowledge and material objects through which a society invests the concepts it lives by with sensuous and psychological force. Taking the development of pottery production in the late prehistoric Near East as a focus, and following anthropological discussions of the development of élite culture, I aim to show how the transition from simple to complex society involved the dislocation of aesthetic labour from everyday practices, and its transposition to a restricted, and politically empowered, sector of society.},

Particularly, the structures and dynamics of such systems have attracted considerable interest. Complex networks may have characteristics of multifractality. In this study, we analyze fractal and multifractal properties of a novel network: the large scale economic network of payments of Estonia, where companies are represented by nodes and the payments done between companies are represented by links. We present a fractal scaling analysis and examine the multifractal behavior of this network by using a sandbox algorithm. Our results indicate the existence of multifractality in this network and consequently, the existence of multifractality in the Estonian economy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that analyzes multifractality of a complex network of payments.},

Our approach, based on percolation theory, leads to a general condition for the critical fraction of nodes, p\_c, that need to be removed before the network disintegrates. We show that for a{\textless}=3 the transition never takes place, unless the network is finite.

	abstract = {Fractals are geometric objects that are self-similar at different scales and whose geometric dimensions differ from so-called fractal dimensions. Fractals describe complex continuous structures in nature. Although indications of self-similarity and fractality of complex networks has been previously observed, it is challenging to adapt the machinery from the theory of fractality of continuous objects to discrete objects such as networks. In this article, we identify and study fractal networks using the innate methods of graph theory and combinatorics. We establish analogues of topological (Lebesgue) and fractal (Hausdorff) dimensions for graphs and demonstrate that they are naturally related to known graph-theoretical characteristics: rank dimension and product dimension. Our approach reveals how self-similarity and fractality of a network are deﬁned by a pattern of overlaps between densely connected network communities. It allows us to identify fractal graphs, explore the relations between graph fractality, graph colourings and graph descriptive complexity, and analyse the fractality of several classes of graphs and network models, as well as of a number of real-life networks. We demonstrate the application of our framework in evolutionary biology and virology by analysing networks of viral strains sampled at different stages of evolution inside their hosts. Our methodology revealed gradual self-organization of intra-host viral populations over the course of infection and their adaptation to the host environment. The obtained results lay a foundation for studying fractal properties of complex networks using combinatorial methods and algorithms.},

	abstract = {Complex networks have been studied extensively due to their relevance to many real systems as diverse as the World-Wide-Web ({WWW}), the Internet, energy landscapes, biological and social networks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. A large number of real networks are called “scale-free” because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node [1, 6, 7]. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not length-scale invariant or self-similar. This conclusion originates from the “small-world” property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the “diameter” of the network [8, 9, 10, 11], rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Nevertheless, here we present a novel approach to the analysis of such networks, revealing that their structure is indeed self-similar. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure which coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given ”size”. Concurrently, we identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box deﬁning a ﬁnite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties, which are shown for the {WWW}, social, cellular and protein-protein interaction networks, help to understand the emergence of the scale-free property in complex networks. They suggest a common self-organization dynamics of diverse networks at diﬀerent scales into a critical state and in turn bring together previously unrelated ﬁelds: the statistical physics of complex networks with renormalization group, fractals and critical phenomena.},

The possibility of a unique growth mechanism for a variety of complex networks in diﬀerent ﬁelds such as biology, technology or sociology is of interest, as it promises to uncover the universal origins of collective behavior. The emergence of self-similarity in complex networks raises the fundamental question of the growth process according to which these structures evolve. Here, we use the concept of renormalization as a mechanism for the growth of fractal and non-fractal modular networks. We show that the key principle that gives rise to the fractal architecture of networks is a strong eﬀective “repulsion” (disassortativity) between the most connected nodes (hubs) on all length scales, rendering them very dispersed. More importantly, we show that a robust network comprised of functional modules, such as a cellular network, necessitates a fractal topology, suggestive of an evolutionary drive for their existence.},

In particular, the number of boundaries nodes B follows a power-law probability density function which scales as B−2. The clusters formed by the boundary nodes are fractals with a fractal dimension df ≈ 2. We present analytical and numerical evidence supporting these results for a broad class of networks.

This paper reviews the scientific evidence for cognitive complexity in domestic pigs and, when appropriate, compares this literature with similar findings in other animals, focusing on some of the more compelling and cutting-edge research results. The goals of this paper are to: 1) frame pig cognition and psychology  in a basic comparative context independent of the livestock production and management setting; and 2) identify areas of research with pigs that are particularly compelling and in need of further investigation. We summarize and discuss several areas of comparative psychology, including nonsocial and social cognition, self-awareness, emotion, and personality. We conclude that there are several areas of research in which the findings are suggestive of complex psychology in pigs. We conclude by calling for more noninvasive cognitive and behavioral research with domestic pigs in non-laboratory settings that allow them to express their natural abilities.},

As a result, he met with his followers almost daily, after morning prayer sessions, to discuss the Gita's contents and meaning as it unfolded before him. This book is the transcription of those daily sessions. The Bhagavad Gita, also called The Song of the Lord, is a 700-line section of a much longer Sanskrit war epic, the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata is considered one of the greatest religious classics of Hinduism. The entire text of the Gita is a conversation between Krishna, an incarnation of the god Vishnu, and a general of one of the armies"--Provided by publisher},

As the climate veers toward catastrophe, the innumerable losses cascading through the biosphere make vividly evident the need for a metamorphosis in our relation to the living land. For too long we've inured ourselves to the wild intelligence of our flesh, taking our primary truths from technologies that hold the living world at a distance. This book subverts that distance, drawing readers ever deeper into their animal senses in order to explore, from within, the elemental kinship between the body and the breathing Earth. Abram shows that from the awakened perspective of the human animal, awareness (or mind) is not an exclusive possession of our species but a lucid quality of the biosphere itself--a quality in which we, along with the oaks and the spiders, steadily participate.--From publisher description},

Teenage abortions accounted for more than 30\% of U.S. abortions in the 1970s, but only 16\% to 18\% since 2001, which suggests {DL}’s panel-data models of crime/arrests and abortion were outdated when published. The results point to a broad range of future research involving teenage behavior. A specific means is proposed to reconcile {DL} with previous articles finding no relationship between crime and abortion.},

	abstract = {Friedrich A. Hayek (1899–1992) is known for his vision of the market economy as an information processing system characterized by spontaneous order: the emergence of coherence through the independent actions of large numbers of individuals, each with limited and local knowledge, coordinated by prices that arise from decentralized processes of competition. Hayek is also known for his advocacy of a broad range of free market policies and, indeed, considered the substantially unregulated market system to be superior to competing alternatives precisely because it made the best use of dispersed knowledge. Our purpose in writing this paper is twofold: First, we believe that Hayek's economic vision and critique of equilibrium theory not only remain relevant, but apply with greater force as information has become ever more central to economic activity and the complexity of the information aggregation process has become increasingly apparent. Second, we wish to call into question Hayek's belief that his advocacy of free market policies follows as a matter of logic from his economic vision. The very usefulness of prices (and other economic variables) as informative messages—which is the centerpiece of Hayek's economics—creates incentives to extract information from signals in ways that can be destabilizing. Markets can promote prosperity but can also generate crises. We will argue, accordingly, that a Hayekian understanding of the economy as an information-processing system does not support the type of policy positions that he favored. Thus, we find considerable lasting value in Hayek's economic analysis while nonetheless questioning the connection of this analysis to his political philosophy.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043},
	abstract = {Because "out-of-the-box" large language models are capable of generating a great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called "jailbreaks" against {LLMs} -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an {LLM} to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods. Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released {LLMs}. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces to {ChatGPT}, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source {LLMs} such as {LLaMA}-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models, raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from producing objectionable information.

	title = {A colonized {COP}: Indigenous exclusion and youth climate justice activism at the United Nations climate change negotiations},
	abstract = {Youth activists around the world are demanding urgent climate action from elected leaders. The annual United Nations climate change negotiations, known as {COPs}, are key sites of global organizing and hope for a comprehensive approach to climate policy. Drawing on participant observation and in-depth interviews at {COP}25 in 2019, this research examines youth climate activists’ priorities, frustrations and hopes for creating just climate policy. Youth are disillusioned with the {COP} process and highlight a variety of ways through which the {COP} perpetuates colonial power structures that marginalize Indigenous peoples and others fighting for justice. This is intersectional exclusion – the character of exclusion experienced by people with multiple intersecting marginalized identities. We demonstrate that the space, policies and even the social movement organizing at {COP}25 are exclusive, necessitating new ways of negotiating, building relationships, and imagining climate solutions that centre Indigenous communities, and protect and return to them the lands on which they depend. As the youth climate justice movement grows, attending to Indigenous priorities will help it transform, rather than reinforce, the systems at the root of climate crisis and to challenge existing policymaking structures.},

	abstract = {In northern Minnesota, the Line 3 tar sands pipeline crosses Indigenous treaty territory, the Mississippi River, and wild rice lakes. Despite the severity of climate crisis and widespread public opposition, Canadian pipeline company Enbridge succeeded in securing permits for, constructing, and ultimately running oil in the pipeline in fall 2021. How was this possible and how did the climate justice movement try to resist? Drawing on participant observation and interviews in the Stop Line 3 movement, this article employs {LeQuesne}'s (2019) concepts of petro-hegemony and carbon rebellion to explain why Line 3 was approved and to assess water protectors' resistance. Analyzing three terrains of power, we find that: 1) the petro-state of Minnesota employed coercion through undemocratic, colonized, and militarized permitting processes and construction; 2) Enbridge manu­ factured consent through a petro-culture that framed water protectors as dangerous, highlighted economic ben­ efits to rural towns, and co-opted Indigenous voices; and, 3) by overstating its contributions to jobs and taxes, Enbridge tried to secure broad compliance to the pipeline through petro-capitalism, but ultimately failed. Water protectors intervened in all three of these terrains of power by using legal avenues to shake the petro-state, creating cultures to refuse colonialism and embrace climate justice within water protector camps, and build­ ing an Indigenous-led renewable energy economy. We contribute a joint analysis of petro-hegemony and carbon rebellion that reveals the need for balanced and stronger resistance in all three terrains of power to stop future petro-projects and dismantle existing petro-infrastructure.},
