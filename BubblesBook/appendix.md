## Results More Powerful then LEM

-   Axiom of Choice

## Results Equivalent to LEM

-   Every subset of a natural number has a cardinality equivalent to a
    natural number.

-   If there is an injection from $A \hookrightarrow B$ and an injection
    from $B \hookrightarrow A$, then there exists a bijection from $A$
    to $B$

## Results that Require LEM

-   The Intermediate Value Theorem

-   Every real matrix can be converted into Row-Echelon form.

## Results that Contradict LEM

-   Every function is computable.

-   Every function between topological spaces is continuous.

-   Every function between the reals is infinitely differentiable.
